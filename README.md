# Mental-Health-and-Personality-Determination-using-Machine-Learning-
This project aims to analyze textual comments from users via a web app to predict their mental health and personality. Data encoding utilized Label Encoder and Count Vectorizer. Various ML models including Logistic Regression, SVM, Random Forest, Naive Bayes, and KNeighbors Classifier were trained, with the top-performing model selected based on accuracy. XGBoost achieved the highest accuracy (67.68%) for personality prediction, identifying 16 distinct personality types across four axes. Logistic Regression attained 96.05% accuracy for mental health prediction. For more details, refer to the IEEE paper at https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9836013.
